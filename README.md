Music-Player:

A Music Player is a web application that allows users to play, pause, and control audio tracks. Using HTML, you structure the player interface with audio controls, a playlist, and buttons for play, pause, next, and previous. CSS enhances the design, making the player visually engaging and responsive. JavaScript adds functionality, enabling features like track selection, playback control, progress tracking, and volume adjustments. This project combines creativity and interactivity, delivering an enjoyable user experience.
